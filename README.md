## Why This Portfolio?

I write for clarity and structure. I’m interested in how writing can influence behavior, simplify the complex, and shift how people understand security. I enjoy making content that feels human without sacrificing technical accuracy.

This is also a playground for other curious minds. If you’re exploring something related to security, communication, or education, and want to build or write together, I’d be happy to talk.
